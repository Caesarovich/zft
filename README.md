# ZFT

This project is a Libft tester written in Zig. I chose Zig because it has great C interoperability and I wanted to learn this language.

## Installation Instructions

To install ZFT, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Caesarovich/zft/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
```

If you want to reinstall ZFT and overwrite the existing installation, you can use the `--reinstall` flag:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Caesarovich/zft/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --reinstall
```

This will clone the repository in your Downloads folder and create an alias `zft` in your `.bashrc` file for easy access.
